 I realized after sending the video that I forgot to mention plenty of other things:
 - Data entry, chefs enter their own data, from the chef app.
 - Automatic and instant google translation to English, where chefs can see and edit the newly entered data before submission.
 - Full Slack and Zapier integrations, where notifications are sent once triggered, for example, putting in an order, or a bug happens, or a crash report, it's sent to a slack chanel.
 - Iporting data into google sheets, happens automatically, after it's sent to slack. There is no more manual data entry for orders, their value, notes..etc.
 - After google sheets, the values are migrated automatically to Quickbooks, which is the accoutning system.
 - Full integration with Google analytics and Facebook analytics\app events.
 - A payment gateway for accepting online payments, Paypal Credit Cards and GooglePay. 

These features are all currently in the app I'm recording in the link above.Should you require more videos, I'll be happy to record them.

I followed these isntructions, and kept UI design to minimal, while keep code simple, commented and readable.

> Simplicity - we don't require an over-engineered solution
> Making the UI look nice is not required as part of this task - legible text and usable UI is sufficient.
